# Code Refactor Starter Code
I was presented the code for the horiseon landing page, where I changed certain html elements in order to follow proper accessibility standards and prioritize search engine optimization.
I changed several div elements to their respective areas on the the page, added alt descriptions for several images, and fixed one of the anchor tags in the nav bar to jump to the appropriate section of the web page.
I changed the selectors in the stylesheet so that they corresponded to my changes without altering the look of the page.
I also added a title to reflect the name of the company.
